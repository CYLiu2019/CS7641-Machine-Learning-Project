For this project, we attempted a variety of supervised classification methods that are well suited to binary classification problems with severe class imbalance. In this section, we describe some background theory, our approaches and results obtained from this step.

  <b>2. Random Forest Classification</b>
</p>
Random forest is a classical tree-based ensemble learning method that constructs multiple individual decision trees in order to evaluate a class assignment of a data point.
